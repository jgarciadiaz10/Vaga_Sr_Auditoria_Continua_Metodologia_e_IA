## 🖥️ System Requirements

To use this software effectively, make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS Mojave or later
- **RAM:** Minimum 4 GB (8 GB recommended for better performance)
- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB of free space
- **Software:** Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor for .md files

## 📂 Using the Datasets

The datasets included serve specific purposes. Here’s what you get:

- **`transacoes.csv`**: This file contains transaction data that you can analyze for patterns and trends.
- **`logs_ia.csv`**: This details interactions with artificial intelligence components, helpful for understanding data processing.
- **`DATA_DICTIONARY.md`**: This markdown file explains the contents of the datasets, ensuring you understand each field and its significance.

## 🔧 Working with Spark/SQL

To analyze the downloaded datasets, you will need a basic understanding of Spark or SQL. Here is how to get started:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   
   - Install Apache Spark or use a cloud-based service like Databricks for easier access.
   - Alternatively, you can run SQL queries directly on the .csv files using tools that support SQL.

2. **Load the Data**

   Use the following samples to load your datasets into your analysis environment:

   ```python
   # For Spark
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Data Analysis").getOrCreate()
   df_transacoes = spark.read.csv("path/to/transacoes.csv", header=True)
   df_logs = spark.read.csv("path/to/logs_ia.csv", header=True)
   ```

3. **Perform Analysis**

   Use Spark or SQL commands to query and manipulate the data. Here is a simple SQL example:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM transacoes WHERE amount > 100;
   ```
